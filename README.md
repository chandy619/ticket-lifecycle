Continuing from the previous lab, I have created a few tickets by the User accounts we created. Users can fill-in all the necessary fields to describe the technical issues they are experiencing and submit it. Above are varied examples of technical issues customers or end-users may encounter in real life.

Now, logged in as an Agent, you get a view of how Help Desk/ IT Support tickets come in and get worked. System Administrators have the ability to (re)assign tickets to appropriate Teams and Agents as well as upgrade or downgrade severity levels to ensure SLAs are met.

Effective communication is important in almost every work setting. In Help Desk/IT Support, it is very important to keep well documented notes on the back-end so your yourself and your team. Tickets can be used as referenced in case you or another agent needs guidance resolving a similar issue. On the front-end, users appreciate good communication as well so keep them informed of any important updates and when their ticket has been resolved.

Continuing from the previous lab, I have created a few tickets by the User accounts we created. Users can fill-in all the necessary fields to describe the technical issues they are experiencing and submit it. Above are varied examples of technical issues customers or end-users may encounter in real life.

Now, logged in as an Agent, you get a view of how Help Desk/ IT Support tickets come in and get worked. System Administrators have the ability to (re)assign tickets to appropriate Teams and Agents as well as upgrade or downgrade priority levels to ensure SLAs are met.

Effective communication is essential in almost every work setting. In Help Desk/IT Support, it is very important to keep well documented notes. On the back-end, it can be proof of your productivity as well as serve as a tutorial for other members on your team. For instance, explaining what steps you took to resolve an issue can help someone else solve a similar issue. On the front-end, users appreciate good communication. Having great communication skills is a pillar in excellent customer service, so keeping people informed with important updates regarding their technical issues, especially when they have been resolved, goes a long way.
